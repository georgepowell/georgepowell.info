<h2>Why creating autonomous honey bee quad-copters is the next logical step.</h2>

<p>From <strong>The Terminator&rsquo;s</strong> cold hearted cyborg assassin, to the heart-throb operating system <em>Samantha</em> in <strong>Her</strong>, science fiction has long been predicting the rise of humanoid robots. The huge potential for AI and robotics to either improve or destroy our society has been illustrated countless times, including Isaac Asimov&rsquo;s dramatic I-robot &ndash; with a utopian work-free society turning quickly to a robot-controlled utilitarian dictatorship. However, regardless of the disruption these technologies will bring, research and innovation into autonomous robotics will continue at an always increasing rate.</p>

<p><a href="http://greenbrain.group.shef.ac.uk/">Sheffield&rsquo;s Green Brain project</a> aims to contribute to this revolution by reverse engineering the brain of a honey bee, and creating autonomous flying honey bee robots controlled by a simulation of the brain. Within the Kroto Innovation center at the University of Sheffield, their setup is impressive: A clinically white observation room, with a large window on one side, sits almost empty apart from three powerful, expensive gaming PCs stacked in the corner, and a grey metallic quad-copter sitting apprehensively in the center.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BimDd5kCQAEjz8A.jpg" alt="Quadcopter flying" /></p>

<p><em>The Green Brain&rsquo;s Quad-copter</em></p>

<p>The quad-copter is the honey bee &ndash; kitted up at every corner with sensors and receivers, mimicking accurately those of an actual bee. The gaming PCs are its <em>brain</em> &ndash; simulating a large and complex neural network on massively parallel GPUs.</p>

<p>This is the result of over two year&rsquo;s hard work from the Green Brain Team &ndash; a small but impressive team of academics and engineers working at Sheffield. This work, they claim, is the next logical step in driving forward our understanding of our minds, and perhaps bringing us closer to the society abound with robots predicted unanimously by science fiction.</p>

<h2>But why a bee?</h2>

<p>You may have heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_collapse_disorder">Colony collapse disorder</a>, it&rsquo;s a name given to the very misunderstood mass-collapse of honey bee populations across the world. It&rsquo;s due to many complex interacting factors that have unfortunately resisted fitting into any sound-bite sized headlines. Bees play a vital role in many ecological systems, so its consequences could be dire: disrupting our food supply and many delicately sustained wildlife habitats that depend on them.</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Apis_mellifera_flying.jpg/320px-Apis_mellifera_flying.jpg" alt="Honey bee" /></p>

<p><em>A Honey Bee</em></p>

<p>Here, some of the goals of the Green Brain Project become justified: If they can simulate a bee from scratch with an accuracy sufficient to reproduce characteristics and behaviours of actual honey bees, they will have developed an invaluable tool to understanding and countering colony collapse disorder. As James Marshall &ndash; the leader of the Green Brain project &ndash; says: &ldquo;robots give behavioural biologists the freedom to explore the mind of an animal in ways that would not be possible with living subjects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Replacing dying honey bees with ungainly flying quad-copters is farfetched at best. And although creating &ldquo;artificial pollinators&rdquo; has been mentioned as a potential direction for this technology, the act of researching and understanding the bee&rsquo;s behaviours is fortunately a more valid and realistic goal in and of itself.</p>

<h2>From worms to humans &ndash; choosing the scale of the next AI</h2>

<p>The Green Brain Project is named after a more ambitious effort &ndash; <a href="http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/page-52063.html">The Blue Brain Project</a> &ndash; which aims to simulate the entire human brain at a molecular level. The Blue Brain project is still in its early stages, having limited success in simulating a single cortical column of a rat. The Green and Blue brain projects are just two of many projects aiming to simulate brains at varying scales.</p>

<p>At the other extreme sits <a href="http://www.openworm.org/getting_started.html">The Open Worm Project</a> aiming to simulate the neural and muscular workings of a microscopic worm, containing only <strong>one-thousand cells</strong> and about <strong>three-hundred neurons</strong>. Although this organism appears simple, the individuals working on the team believe it&rsquo;s the right scale to focus on given our current level of technology and biological understanding, and they might be right: even making quite basic predictions about the worm&rsquo;s movement based on their simulation has been very difficult.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.artificialbrains.com/images/openworm/openworm-nervous-system-3d-green.png" alt="Worm" /></p>

<p><em>A Graphical representation of the Open Worm Simulation</em></p>

<p>Although these projects have different ambitions, working at dramatically different scales, they are producing new results and knowledge that will help each other progress faster than they ever could alone. There is no single correct scale that brain simulation research should focus; it is only by tackling the questions from every angle at once that we can understand the problem space deeply.</p>

<h2>The reality is tough</h2>

<p>Both the Blue Brain and Open Worm projects exist purely in a simulated world. This comes with a huge amount of freedom; it&rsquo;s easier to measure, manipulate and control virtual worlds &ndash; the temptation is obvious. However, the Green Brain is built to control a physical quad-copter in the real world.</p>

<p>A well-known joke goes as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>The problem with engineers is that they tend to cheat in order to get results.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>The problem with mathematicians is that they tend to work on toy problems in order to get results.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>The problem with computer scientists is that they tend tocheat at toy problems in order to get results.</em></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Simulating a brain should not be a toy problem. There&rsquo;s no reason a realistic simulation of the honey bee brain, or any other brain, should be clean and mathematically elegant &ndash; <strong>it needs to work in real life</strong>. Ensuring this focus on results in the messy and complicated real world is the reason behind the Green Brain&rsquo;s physical manifestation as a quad-copter. Virtual worlds and simulations are, by their definition, mere cleaned-up estimations of the real world. The team believe, with good reason, that pushing their simulation to work in real environments will force them to solve difficult problems that might have been simplified away in a virtual world.</p>

<p><em>The Green Brain Project&rsquo;s testing room</em></p>

<h2>The rise of the quad</h2>

<p>Although the first recorded quad-copter was built over 100 years ago, they have only recently become widely utilised. A number of popular videos and articles – including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2itwFJCgFQ">an awe-inspiring TED talk</a> claiming over 2.5 million views &ndash; popularised the quad-copter and initialised a large boom in funding for multi-copter related projects. This sudden utilisation of multi-copters became possible due to a number of advances in technology, including wide availability of cheap, light and small computers, powerful and compact LiPo batteries, and efficient propeller motors.</p>

<p><img src="/images/trends.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Popularity of the word ‘quadcopter’ over time on Google Trends</em></p>

<h2>Why are quad-copters so popular?</h2>

<p>The answer is mechanical simplicity. In layman terms, a helicopter can control its acceleration by changing the pitch of its blades <em>as they spin around. </em>This is called a <em>variable-pitch rotor. </em>It allows for a large degree of control and efficiency, but the mechanism is complicated and prone to failure, particularly at small scales.</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Navy-hh1n-158256-070327-16cr-10.jpg/320px-Navy-hh1n-158256-070327-16cr-10.jpg" alt="Helicopter" /></p>

<p><em>A variable-pitch rotor system on a helicopter; efficient but mechanically complex.</em></p>

<p>Due to having 4 blades, quad-copters can control themselves without the need for a variable-pitch rotor. However, contrary to popular belief, quad-copters are less efficient and less stable than a classical helicopter. Stabilising a quad-copter in-flight requires a low-latency central control system which feeds instructions rapidly back to the motors based on sensors and measurements from its accelerometer, gyroscope, and sometimes even GPS. However, the lack of a complicated variable-pitch rotor system and the incredible power and versatility gained from a computerised control system has led to quad and multi-copters gaining a dominance within the world of small-scale drones.</p>

<h2>If you can’t beat them…</h2>

<p>Robotics projects like the Green Brain will continue being funded, and general progress in robotics will increasingly influence our lives, but the transformations they bring will be complicated.</p>

<p>Richard Feynman described the limitations of science in his book <em>The Meaning of it All</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Science and moral questions are independent. The common human problem, the big question, always is “Should I do this?” It is a question of action. “What should I do?” How can we answer such a question? We can divide it into two parts: We can say, “If I do this what will happen?” and “Well, do I want that to happen?” The first question is the typical scientific question. The method is “Try it and see.” But the question “Do I want this to happen?” is not scientific. Well, you say, if I do this, I see that everybody is killed, and, of course, I don’t want that! Well, how do you know you don’t want people killed? You see, at the end you must have some ultimate judgment.</p></blockquote>

<p>Science and technology are hailed by some as an ultimate solution to many of life’s problems, but technology provides indiscriminate power – neither intrinsically positive nor negative. History has shown power only leads to prosperity when placed into the right hands; the internet has revolutionised the free press, but nuclear weapons are a constant ongoing threat to world peace.</p>

<p><strong>The robots are coming</strong>, and although science will be responsible for their arrival, it will not guide us on how they should be used. Nobody can predict the eventual consequences of autonomous robotics spreading into our society, but as I long as I have the choice, <strong>I’d like to be on their side</strong>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Imaginary numbers and the nature of mathematics</h1>

<p>I first heard of imaginary numbers when someone showed me the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot Set</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nnOUsGwmsEw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/xgyUbcFMo6g/photo.jp" alt="Mandelbrot visualisation" /></p>

<p>They described it to me:</p>

<blockquote><p>The x axis is for the real numbers, and the y axis is for the imaginary numbers. The colour of each pixel is determined by the properties of the imaginary and real numbers it represents.</p></blockquote>

<p>My reaction was confusion, as it should have been. That picture sure doesn&rsquo;t look imaginary. And how can these numbers exist on a computer if they&rsquo;re imaginary? Maybe I&rsquo;m not smart enough to understand, maybe it&rsquo;s a concept only accessible to the minds of mathematitions. What are imaginary numbers?</p>

<blockquote><p>Well&hellip; They&rsquo;re <em>made up</em> numbers that don&rsquo;t really exist like normal numbers do. There&rsquo;s <strong>no</strong> number that can be squared into a negative number, so we make up the imaginary numbers!</p></blockquote>

<p>I learnt to program in my teens and when I <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/501340">wrote my own mandelbrot set visualiser</a> I realised it doesn&rsquo;t really need <em>imaginary-made-up</em> numbers after all. All it needs is two standard real numbers and a formula.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s &lsquo;imaginary&rsquo; about imaginary numbers then? Well &lsquo;real&rsquo; negative numbers don&rsquo;t have &lsquo;real&rsquo; square roots, so we call their roots &lsquo;imaginary&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a <em>name</em>. Are they more imaginary that the &lsquo;real&rsquo; numbers? No. You don&rsquo;t need a special type of calculator or a special kind of pen to calculate with imaginary numbers. It&rsquo;s really not the best naming decision: calling a fundamental and useful concept &lsquo;imaginary&rsquo; scares and confuses people away from trying to understand it. The crux to understanding imaginary numbers is to realise how normal and unimaginary they really are.</p>

<p>Mathematics studies <em>formal abstractions</em> &ndash; mental constructions that have been defined so carefully and unambiguously that their properties become objective. 1, 2, 3 and the rest of the counting numbers, they&rsquo;re all abstractions: concepts we create to categorise, percieve and understand the world. We use abstractions to represent things, and whether abstractions are &lsquo;real&rsquo; or not doesn&rsquo;t even matter; <em>they&rsquo;re all as real or unreal as each other</em>. <strong>Imaginary numbers and real numbers exist equivalently as mathematical abstractions</strong>; useful tools to represent the world we live in.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the way the mind works. We develop concepts and abstractions to represent the world and its behaviour &ndash; mathematics studies the subset of these concepts that have been formally defined. To know <em>what infinity is</em>, or <em>what an imaginary number is</em>, is really just knowing how the mind uses abstractions to represent our surroundings.</p>

<p>The view that mathematics is just concepts and abstractions in our psychology is far from the only accepted philosophy. There&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics#Contemporary_schools_of_thought">plenty of schools of thought</a> around what maths is. For me, however, any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism">existential or borderline-spiritual</a> view of mathematical knowledge has caused more confusion and  gotten in the way of learning the actual maths.</p>

    <link href="http://georgepowell.info/writing/greshams-law-and-bitcoin-deflation/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-10T12:26:40+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://georgepowell.info/writing/greshams-law-and-bitcoin-deflation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&rsquo;re at the local store buying some bread and milk. The cashier asks you for £3.35. You open your wallet and you&rsquo;ve got two £5 notes:</p>

<h3>Crusty old £5:</h3>

<p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/03/21/article-0-00F3EED2000004B0-407_468x263.jpg" alt="Old note" /></p>

<h3>Crisp new £5:</h3>

<p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/08/24/article-0-00F3EED2000004B0-777_468x249.jpg" alt="New note" /></p>

<p>Which one do you give to the cashier?</p>

<p>Unless you&rsquo;re feeling kind &ndash; that is, you&rsquo;re not an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus">economic man</a> &ndash; you&rsquo;d want to get rid of your crusty old £5 note; they&rsquo;re worth the same amount to the cashier, so you&rsquo;d be a fool to give up the shiny new one for nothing extra. This is the basis of a paradoxical truth in economics: the measure of a currency&rsquo;s success is if it is used in transactions, yet the <em>shiny, new, better</em> £5 notes will get hoarded while the old ones get traded. <strong>People want to get rid of <em>bad</em> currency, which means it&rsquo;s used more in transactions</strong>. Enter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham's_law">Gresham&rsquo;s Law</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Gresham&rsquo;s law is an economic principle that states: &ldquo;When a government overvalues one type of money and undervalues another, the undervalued money will leave the country or disappear from circulation into hoards, while the overvalued money will flood into circulation.&rdquo; It is commonly stated as: &ldquo;Bad money drives out good&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

<p> We can rewrite the above scenario with bitcoin replacing the new shiny £5 note, and our standard fiat currencies as the old one. Presuming bitcoin is accepted universally and is as easy to pay with as paying by card, which one should you choose?</p>

<p> Bitcoin is digital gold: there is a finite supply. Cash is subject to continuous steady inflation: its value will always be gradually decreasing. So assuming the novelty of spending bitcoin has worn off in this future, it would make sense to keep your value-preserving-bitcoin and get rid of your cash. This is one reason why economists critisise the deflationary (or at least zero-inflation) nature of bitcoin.</p>

<p> The reality is complex, however, and this property doesn&rsquo;t necessarily detract from its other advantages. But this is one reason for believing that even if bitcoin is successful, it won&rsquo;t <em>replace</em> other currencies too easily.</p>

    <link href="http://georgepowell.info/writing/big-pharma-book-review/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-09T10:28:57+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://georgepowell.info/writing/big-pharma-book-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://sciencebasedpharmacy.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/bad-pharma.png" alt="Bad Pharma book cover" /></p>

<p>We take pride in our western medicine. We believe it is evidence based, objective, and working with the correct incentives. Instead, Ben Goldacre writes: <em>(p238)</em></p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip; We have occasional, small brief trials, in unrepresentative populations, testing irrelevant comparisons, measuring irrelevant outcomes, with whole trials that go missing, avoidable design flaws, and endless reporting biases that only persist because research is conducted chaotically, for commercial gain, in spuriously expensive trials. The poor-quality evidence created by this system harms patients around the world.  <strong>And if we wanted, we could fix it.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>This is a powerful book, with a clear and unforgiving message: Western medicine is not as scientific as we are told; the system is corrupt and industries work with their own profits in mind.</p>

<h3>Bad Science</h3>

<p>Goldacre is known for his blog &ndash; <a href="http://www.badscience.net/">Bad Science</a>, where he debunks claims ranging from the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/nov/16/sciencenews.g2">proficiency of homeopathy</a> to the popular <a href="http://www.badscience.net/2007/02/ms-gillian-mckeith-banned-from-calling-herself-a-doctor/">nutrician supplements of &ldquo;Dr&rdquo; Gillian Mckieth</a>. He turns his attention here to the more serious mispractices going on in western medicine as a whole.</p>

<p>It is a long book, covering over 350 pages excluding notes, illustrating his points with shocking stories and backing them up with hard evidence where possible. He covers many topics, ranging from the widely unsolved positive publication bias in academic journals, to &lsquo;regulatory capture&rsquo;: how pharmacutical companies become their own regulators. The book ends with an unforgiving tour-de-force breakdown of how marketting is used to decieve doctors and patients.</p>

<p>Goldacre knows this isn&rsquo;t an academic paper, and he communicates to his readers early on that it shouldn&rsquo;t be treated as one. However the result is a book that treads a confusing line between sensationalist popular science and a seminal analysis of a very serious problem. The points in this book, however, need to be treated with respect by the people in power, even though it is aimed at the general public.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed and learnt a lot from this book, and I&rsquo;d recommend it especially to those involved in medicine &ndash; who will be in a better position than I am to comment on the problems raised here, and maybe do something about them.</p>

    <link href="http://georgepowell.info/writing/giving-up-on-bitcoin/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-08T14:33:37+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://georgepowell.info/writing/giving-up-on-bitcoin</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Please note I&rsquo;m not an expert on Bitcoin. I write about this stuff for fun.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been close to investing in Bitcoin over the past couple of months; its promise as a technology comparable to the internet of 20 years ago is severely tempting. If it ever gains wide acceptence, even a small investment could be worth big money in the coming decades. But I&rsquo;ve given up &ndash; for the moment at least &ndash; on that hope. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>

<h3>Money for the people</h3>

<p>Bitcoin is oft peddled with an economic libertarian ideology. Our fiat currencies are controlled and regulated by the banks and governments, adding fees and friction to transactions. By relying on the system as it is, we hand our power to an unrepresentative minority who can profit from and manipulate our fiat currencies, not necessarily with the majority&rsquo;s best interests in mind. Bitcoin is a decentralised currency that can&rsquo;t be controlled by an individual party, it lets regular folk and small businesses make transactions to each other without needing to trust a third party. This is true, but it&rsquo;s not the whole story.</p>

<h3>The current system</h3>

<p>To gain a real understanding of where bitcoin sits as a technology, we need to understand how the current system works, and what problems (if any) bitcoin solves.</p>

<p>First, lets look at hard cash &ndash; the stuff we carry around in our wallets. Already, cash has some of the essential properties that bitcoin claims: It&rsquo;s untracable, unregulatable, and anonymous; perhaps to a greater extent even than bitcoin. Cash is used for drugs, weapons, money laundering, untaxed income, you name it. Nobody can charge a small business for the right to accept cash. Cash falls down at two hurdles, however: it&rsquo;s not digital, and control of its production is centralised. We&rsquo;ll look at what this really means in a second.</p>

<p>Now lets look at banks and the digitised money they offer through debit and credit cards. By digitising our cash and giving it to the banks, some important things have now changed: it is no longer untracable, anonymous, and unregulatable. By trusting the banks with our money we have sacrificed this for some serious benefits: They keep our money more secure than we could realistically keep cash, they offer fast digital transactions around the world and online, often with no fees or friction, and they offer interest on our savings at no extra cost. The currency is still the same as our cash, so production doesn&rsquo;t change hands. The important thing to realise here is that banks are offering a real service to us in securing and digitising our cash, and in some sense bitcoin must solve a problem not already solved by the combination of modern banking and cash.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Bitcoin as a product</h3>

<p>Finally, lets look at how bitcoin fairs.</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s digital. Like the online banking and cards offered by the banks, bitcoin allows transactions to anywhere in the world with the click of a button.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s pseudoanonymous. In practise, this means that your bitcoin transactions are all tied to a pseudo-identity, which can be in theory unconnected to your real world identity. Although in practise this is hard to achieve without some knowhow in computers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNssKmeXrGs">Jerry Brito claims in an interview with Vice that you&rsquo;d need to buy bitcoin on the street with cash to guarentee full anonymity.</a></li>
<li>It&rsquo;s decentralised. This removes the need to trust a third party to manage transactions and inflation.</li>
</ul>


<h3>What bitcoin brings to the table</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s summarise:</p>

<h5>Bitcoin is</h5>

<ul>
<li>a pseudo-anonymous digital currecy.</li>
<li>a decentralised digital currency.</li>
<li>a completely fee-free digital currency (minus fees to miners)</li>
</ul>


<h5>Bitcoin is not</h5>

<ul>
<li>the only digital currency.</li>
<li>the only anonymous currency.</li>
<li>the only fee-free digital currency, for many transfers/transactions.</li>
</ul>


<p>Naturally, this leads to the question: Why would the average consumer want to switch to bitcoin? Who does bitcoin offer a real service to?</p>

<p>Anonymity is useful for people who don&rsquo;t want to be caught. Bitcoin offers a genuinely useful product for drug dealers, money launderers, and privacy enthusiasts. In these circles bitcoin is already widely used as a currency.</p>

<p>Decentralisation is desirable for those <strong>who don&rsquo;t trust the banks, and don&rsquo;t want the extra services they offer</strong>. A good example of this is when <a href="http://www.wired.com/2010/12/paypal-wikileaks/">paypal froze payments/donations to WikiLeaks</a>, bitcoin cannot in principle be controlled like this and so it became useful as a means to make donations. Bitcoin thrives here when banks/governments fail in the eyes of enough people. Until then, however, in the battle for your digital transactions, banks offer faster transactions, more security, interest on your money, and many other services that bitcoin does not.</p>

<p>Keeping your money in bitcoin means transactions take minutes rather than seconds to authorise, you have complete responsibility over your private-key &ndash; meaning there&rsquo;s no security to fraud and hacking. The government and banks don&rsquo;t respect it, and for the moment at least, most businesses don&rsquo;t accept it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get swept up in the pro-bitcoin mantra, however I struggle to see what bitcoin offers the majority of the population. It&rsquo;s important to analyse the currency as a product competing with what the banks already offer. Who really wants to sacrifice the services, security and regulation offered by the banks in exchange for a difficult to maintain anonymity and a vague feeling of control?</p>

<p>Bitcoin may be an important product to countries who&rsquo;s currencies are failing them, and to those who need anonymity. But bitcoin needs to offer a lot more to gain anything other than a minority acceptance.</p>

<hr />

<h1>&lsquo;Bitcoin banks&rsquo; and regulation</h1>

<p>Writing the above, I&rsquo;d made the assumption that people store all their bitcoins in their personal bitcoin wallets, and there was no such thing as a <em>Bitcoin bank</em>. The analogy goes like this: If your personal bitcoin wallet is like cash, then there can exist a &lsquo;bitcoin bank&rsquo; that provides the desirable services (like security) given by conventional banks but with bitcoin. In theory, this is possible. And it is here where government regulation becomes very relevant.</p>

<p>Google &lsquo;Bitcoin Bank&rsquo; and the first result is <a href="http://flexcoin.com">flexcoin.com</a>. The information on their website is telling&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Flexcoin is shutting down.</strong> On March 2nd 2014 Flexcoin was attacked and robbed of all coins in the hot wallet. The attacker made off with 896 BTC&hellip; As Flexcoin does not have the resources, assets, or otherwise to come back from this loss, we are closing our doors immediately.</p></blockquote>

<p>The &lsquo;bank&rsquo;, existing to provide security and financial services to bitcoin users, ended up doing exactly the opposite and there&rsquo;s nothing that can be done about it; Bitcoin is not regarded as a currency by government and regulatory organisations, and so bitcoin exchanges and banks go unregulated too. Flexcoin is not alone; <a href="http://lyle.smu.edu/~tylerm/fc13.pdf">nearly 50% of all bitcoin exchanges have failed</a>. Look at the <a href="http://www.flexcoin.com/41.html">legal notice on their information page</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Legal Notice:</strong> We are not a true bank that accepts USD or any national currency, only bitcoins which by their nature are not regulated, we’re not FDIC insured or regulated by any government entity.</p></blockquote>

<p>With proper regulation on bitcoin banks and exchanges, flexcoin.com might not have been allowed to exist as it did, and maybe some people would have saved their money. It&rsquo;s important to remember here that regulation is <em>for the banks, not the currency</em>, and at least in the ideal case, its purpose is to avoid catastrophes like flexcoin and MtGox.</p>

<p>Bitcoin banks may in theory be able to provide the same services as conventional banks, but current attempts have widely failed, especially when it comes to security. This is a product of the decentralised and unregulated nature of bitcoin, so time will tell if innovative companies can provide sufficient services to make bitcoin as usable. But the hurdles of regulation and security have yet to be passed.</p>
