    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s a philosophical position that goes something like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>A statement that has no <em>predictive</em> power, and therefore cannot be shown to be true or false, is meaningless.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is an attractive stance for the scientist who spends his or her life investigating and refining predictive models; it suggests a true objectivity to the world. It narrows the scope of knowledge down to that in which they are an expert. And if there&rsquo;s one undebatable truth in philosophy, it&rsquo;s that there are no undebatable truths in philosophy. And even that&rsquo;s debated.</p>

<p>Philosophical knowledge, by its very nature, is that set of knowledge that cannot be verified by experiment. It can&rsquo;t have predictive power: if it did it would no longer be philosophical. To the hard-line scientist, this is the ultimate shoot-down to philosophy, it makes philosophy meaningless.</p>

<p>But there is a second role of knowledge missing from this view. Even without predictive power, knowledge and beliefs effect our behaviour and decisions. Enter moral philosophy: the world of knowledge that, despite not being verifiable, influences every action we make. Although, to the scientist, subjectivity may be seen as inherently negative, even the most stringent scientist will hold personal ethical beliefs, out of touch from their science. It&rsquo;s the point of the quote that ended my <a href="/../writing/i-for-one-welcome-our-new-insect-overlords/">last post</a>; talking about the inability of science to guide our decisions, Feynman concludes: <em>&ldquo;&hellip; at the end, <strong>you</strong> must have some ultimate judgment.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h2>Moral framework</h2>

<p>A moral framework is a set of beliefs &ndash; held by an individual &ndash; that can be used to ultimately answer all behavioural dilemmas. It fills the gap left by science, and exists as the ultimate end to <em>why</em> we do something the way we do. It adds a connection between our ideas of <em>good</em> and <em>bad</em> and the real world. To use a moral framework is to take a choice of possible actions, judge their worth according to the criteria withing the framework, and choose the action of the most moral worth. As a computer scientist, it is analagous to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space_search">state-space search</a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">mini-max algorithm</a> &ndash; both exist to make decisions in a simulated world based purely on some external measure of &ldquo;success&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Although moral frameworks are subjective, most of us share some intuitive, ambigious ideas of right and wrong. It&rsquo;s wrong to hurt someone. It&rsquo;s wrong to take away someone&rsquo;s freedom. Our actions may be judged by their consequences to people&rsquo;s happiness. Our actions may also be judged on our <em>intent</em>. Some actions can be wrong <em>in principle</em>, regardless of circumstance. These views can all be true to different extents for different people. And people struggle internally with how to bind them together into a single unambiguous moral framework. It&rsquo;s possible to try and reason and justify these views, but being within the realm of philosophical knowledge, it often results in unresolvable ideological food-fights.</p>

<h2>Where does science come in?</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s established that science alone cannot derive an objective moral framework or ideology. It&rsquo;s the ultimate reason that political debate often seems so futile and endless. It creates a frustration amongst scientists, so used to seeking objectivity in their field, that they call for scientific principles to be introduced into policy making &ndash; with the hope of ending this ongoing political shouting in favour of evidence based policy. <strong>But if our ideologies are personally chosen, what is the role of science in policy making?</strong></p>

<p>A policy is not the same as an ideology. A policy is a set of real-world rules, that have real-world consequences <em>hopefully</em> pushing society closer to the ideals of the policy-creator. Say the politician in charge is a libertarian: he believes the worth of a policy should be judged by its effects in enabling <strong>individual freedom. </strong>The policy gives people freedom? <strong>GOOD.</strong> The policy takes away people&rsquo;s freedom? <strong>BAD.</strong> The politician justifies his no-taxes, no-regulation economic policies with his ideology:</p>

<blockquote><p>Taxes and regulation take away the freedom of individuals to trade with each other as they both see fit. Taking away money and enforcing our own rules on other people&rsquo;s personal trades is <em>wrong</em> because they should have the freedom to trade with each other as they want, so long as the trade doesn&rsquo;t take away the rights of others.</p></blockquote>

<p>On its surface, it may look like this policy is only debatable on ideological grounds. But look deeper and we can see how this policy actually has two parts: The ideology is to promote freedom to individuals, the claim is that reducing taxes and regulation <em>will result</em> in satisfying these ends.</p>

<p>Say the policy is implemented. People are free to trade as they see fit within the lenient restraints of the new &lsquo;libertarian&rsquo; society. Say, over time the economy grows and large companies are allowed to form and merge. It turns out, in this society, that it is in the large companies' profit interests to fix prices and create repressive monopolies &ndash; harvesting all wealth from the less well off and restricting their employment options so, given a <em>free</em> choice under the law, citizens <em>have</em> to choose to work for the monopolistic companies. It&rsquo;s the only option to survive. Would the libertarian politician &ndash; who values social mobility and individual freedoms &ndash; consider this society &lsquo;free&rsquo;? If he&rsquo;d have known that the long term consequences of his policies would be that the 99% do not have a practical choice over their lifestyle or employment?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a hypothetical story, the point is not about economics, and it is especially not a criticism aimed at the libertarian ideology. Instead, the story illustrates that an acceptable justification of a policy rests on more than just an ideology. It should rest on evidence that the <em>policy&rsquo;s consequences work towards the ideology.</em> The failure of the above policy in achieving its ideological aims was not a fault of the ideology itself, it was the fault of the politician&rsquo;s naive understanding of the policy&rsquo;s consequences.</p>

<h2>Evidence based policy</h2>

<p>When scientists like me call for science based policy, we should call for the <em>consequences</em> of policies to be investigated scientifically, not their ideological foundations. A country being run without this step of investigation cannot make educated choices between policies. The naivity of politicians regarding the effects of their own policies is solvable with science, and it is here that science based policy should flourish. Ignorance about the limitations of science, which politicians may be more aware of than scientists, unecessarily weakens the otherwise valid and important efforts of scientists in improving the quality of our policies. Science should have its place in politics, but misunderstandings and confusions about the roles of science and ideology need to be tackled before the scientific method can be fully taken advantage of within politics.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post was written as a university assignment April 2014. I&rsquo;ve been offered a 6 week internship working for the Green Brain Project in Summer 2014.</em></p>

<h2>Why creating autonomous honey bee quad-copters is the next logical step.</h2>

<p>From <strong>The Terminator&rsquo;s</strong> cold hearted cyborg assassin, to the heart-throb operating system <em>Samantha</em> in <strong>Her</strong>, science fiction has long been predicting the rise of humanoid robots. The huge potential for AI and robotics to either improve or destroy our society has been illustrated countless times, including Isaac Asimov&rsquo;s dramatic I-robot &ndash; with a utopian work-free society turning quickly to a robot-controlled utilitarian dictatorship. However, regardless of the disruption these technologies will bring, research and innovation into autonomous robotics will continue at an always increasing rate.</p>

<p><a href="http://greenbrain.group.shef.ac.uk/">Sheffield&rsquo;s Green Brain project</a> aims to contribute to this revolution by reverse engineering the brain of a honey bee, and creating autonomous flying honey bee robots controlled by a simulation of the brain. Within the Kroto Innovation center at the University of Sheffield, their setup is impressive: A clinically white observation room, with a large window on one side, sits almost empty apart from three powerful, expensive gaming PCs stacked in the corner, and a grey metallic quad-copter sitting apprehensively in the center.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BimDd5kCQAEjz8A.jpg" alt="Quadcopter flying" /></p>

<p><em>The Green Brain&rsquo;s Quad-copter</em></p>

<p>The quad-copter is the honey bee &ndash; kitted up at every corner with sensors and receivers, mimicking accurately those of an actual bee. The gaming PCs are its <em>brain</em> &ndash; simulating a large and complex neural network on massively parallel GPUs.</p>

<p>This is the result of over two year&rsquo;s hard work from the Green Brain Team &ndash; a small but impressive team of academics and engineers working at Sheffield. This work, they claim, is the next logical step in driving forward our understanding of our minds, and perhaps bringing us closer to the society abound with robots predicted unanimously by science fiction.</p>

<h2>But why a bee?</h2>

<p>You may have heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_collapse_disorder">Colony collapse disorder</a>, it&rsquo;s a name given to the very misunderstood mass-collapse of honey bee populations across the world. It&rsquo;s due to many complex interacting factors that have unfortunately resisted fitting into any sound-bite sized headlines. Bees play a vital role in many ecological systems, so its consequences could be dire: disrupting our food supply and many delicately sustained wildlife habitats that depend on them.</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Apis_mellifera_flying.jpg/320px-Apis_mellifera_flying.jpg" alt="Honey bee" /></p>

<p><em>A Honey Bee</em></p>

<p>Here, some of the goals of the Green Brain Project become justified: If they can simulate a bee from scratch with an accuracy sufficient to reproduce characteristics and behaviours of actual honey bees, they will have developed an invaluable tool to understanding and countering colony collapse disorder. As James Marshall &ndash; the leader of the Green Brain project &ndash; says: &ldquo;robots give behavioural biologists the freedom to explore the mind of an animal in ways that would not be possible with living subjects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Replacing dying honey bees with ungainly flying quad-copters is farfetched at best. And although creating &ldquo;artificial pollinators&rdquo; has been mentioned as a potential direction for this technology, the act of researching and understanding the bee&rsquo;s behaviours is fortunately a more valid and realistic goal in and of itself.</p>

<h2>From worms to humans &ndash; choosing the scale of the next AI</h2>

<p>The Green Brain Project is named after a more ambitious effort &ndash; <a href="http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/page-52063.html">The Blue Brain Project</a> &ndash; which aims to simulate the entire human brain at a molecular level. The Blue Brain project is still in its early stages, having limited success in simulating a single cortical column of a rat. The Green and Blue brain projects are just two of many projects aiming to simulate brains at varying scales.</p>

<p>At the other extreme sits <a href="http://www.openworm.org/getting_started.html">The Open Worm Project</a> aiming to simulate the neural and muscular workings of a microscopic worm, containing only <strong>one-thousand cells</strong> and about <strong>three-hundred neurons</strong>. Although this organism appears simple, the individuals working on the team believe it&rsquo;s the right scale to focus on given our current level of technology and biological understanding, and they might be right: even making quite basic predictions about the worm&rsquo;s movement based on their simulation has been very difficult.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.artificialbrains.com/images/openworm/openworm-nervous-system-3d-green.png" alt="Worm" /></p>

<p><em>A Graphical representation of the Open Worm Simulation</em></p>

<p>Although these projects have different ambitions, working at dramatically different scales, they are producing new results and knowledge that will help each other progress faster than they ever could alone. There is no single correct scale that brain simulation research should focus; it is only by tackling the questions from every angle at once that we can understand the problem space deeply.</p>

<h2>The reality is tough</h2>

<p>Both the Blue Brain and Open Worm projects exist purely in a simulated world. This comes with a huge amount of freedom; it&rsquo;s easier to measure, manipulate and control virtual worlds &ndash; the temptation is obvious. However, the Green Brain is built to control a physical quad-copter in the real world.</p>

<p>A well-known joke goes as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>The problem with engineers is that they tend to cheat in order to get results.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>The problem with mathematicians is that they tend to work on toy problems in order to get results.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>The problem with computer scientists is that they tend tocheat at toy problems in order to get results.</em></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Simulating a brain should not be a toy problem. There&rsquo;s no reason a realistic simulation of the honey bee brain, or any other brain, should be clean and mathematically elegant &ndash; <strong>it needs to work in real life</strong>. Ensuring this focus on results in the messy and complicated real world is the reason behind the Green Brain&rsquo;s physical manifestation as a quad-copter. Virtual worlds and simulations are, by their definition, mere cleaned-up estimations of the real world. The team believe, with good reason, that pushing their simulation to work in real environments will force them to solve difficult problems that might have been simplified away in a virtual world.</p>

<p><em>The Green Brain Project&rsquo;s testing room</em></p>

<h2>The rise of the quad</h2>

<p>Although the first recorded quad-copter was built over 100 years ago, they have only recently become widely utilised. A number of popular videos and articles – including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2itwFJCgFQ">an awe-inspiring TED talk</a> claiming over 2.5 million views &ndash; popularised the quad-copter and initialised a large boom in funding for multi-copter related projects. This sudden utilisation of multi-copters became possible due to a number of advances in technology, including wide availability of cheap, light and small computers, powerful and compact LiPo batteries, and efficient propeller motors.</p>

<p><img src="/images/trends.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Popularity of the word ‘quadcopter’ over time on Google Trends</em></p>

<h2>Why are quad-copters so popular?</h2>

<p>The answer is mechanical simplicity. In layman terms, a helicopter can control its acceleration by changing the pitch of its blades <em>as they spin around. </em>This is called a <em>variable-pitch rotor. </em>It allows for a large degree of control and efficiency, but the mechanism is complicated and prone to failure, particularly at small scales.</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/Navy-hh1n-158256-070327-16cr-10.jpg/320px-Navy-hh1n-158256-070327-16cr-10.jpg" alt="Helicopter" /></p>

<p><em>A variable-pitch rotor system on a helicopter; efficient but mechanically complex.</em></p>

<p>Due to having 4 blades, quad-copters can control themselves without the need for a variable-pitch rotor. However, contrary to popular belief, quad-copters are less efficient and less stable than a classical helicopter. Stabilising a quad-copter in-flight requires a low-latency central control system which feeds instructions rapidly back to the motors based on sensors and measurements from its accelerometer, gyroscope, and sometimes even GPS. However, the lack of a complicated variable-pitch rotor system and the incredible power and versatility gained from a computerised control system has led to quad and multi-copters gaining a dominance within the world of small-scale drones.</p>

<h2>If you can’t beat them…</h2>

<p>Robotics projects like the Green Brain will continue being funded, and general progress in robotics will increasingly influence our lives, but the transformations they bring will be complicated.</p>

<p>Richard Feynman described the limitations of science in his book <em>The Meaning of it All</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Science and moral questions are independent. The common human problem, the big question, always is “Should I do this?” It is a question of action. “What should I do?” How can we answer such a question? We can divide it into two parts: We can say, “If I do this what will happen?” and “Well, do I want that to happen?” The first question is the typical scientific question. The method is “Try it and see.” But the question “Do I want this to happen?” is not scientific. Well, you say, if I do this, I see that everybody is killed, and, of course, I don’t want that! Well, how do you know you don’t want people killed? You see, at the end you must have some ultimate judgment.</p></blockquote>

<p>Science and technology are hailed by some as an ultimate solution to many of life’s problems, but technology provides indiscriminate power – neither intrinsically positive nor negative. History has shown power only leads to prosperity when placed into the right hands; the internet has revolutionised the free press, but nuclear weapons are a constant ongoing threat to world peace.</p>

<p><strong>The robots are coming</strong>, and although science will be responsible for their arrival, it will not guide us on how they should be used. Nobody can predict the eventual consequences of autonomous robotics spreading into our society, but as I long as I have the choice, <strong>I’d like to be on their side</strong>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Imaginary numbers and the nature of mathematics</h1>

<p>I first heard of imaginary numbers when someone showed me the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot Set</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nnOUsGwmsEw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/xgyUbcFMo6g/photo.jp" alt="Mandelbrot visualisation" /></p>

<p>They described it to me:</p>

<blockquote><p>The x axis is for the real numbers, and the y axis is for the imaginary numbers. The colour of each pixel is determined by the properties of the imaginary and real numbers it represents.</p></blockquote>

<p>My reaction was confusion, as it should have been. That picture sure doesn&rsquo;t look imaginary. And how can these numbers exist on a computer if they&rsquo;re imaginary? Maybe I&rsquo;m not smart enough to understand, maybe it&rsquo;s a concept only accessible to the minds of mathematitions. What are imaginary numbers?</p>

<blockquote><p>Well&hellip; They&rsquo;re <em>made up</em> numbers that don&rsquo;t really exist like normal numbers do. There&rsquo;s <strong>no</strong> number that can be squared into a negative number, so we make up the imaginary numbers!</p></blockquote>

<p>I learnt to program in my teens and when I <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/501340">wrote my own mandelbrot set visualiser</a> I realised it doesn&rsquo;t really need <em>imaginary-made-up</em> numbers after all. All it needs is two standard real numbers and a formula.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s &lsquo;imaginary&rsquo; about imaginary numbers then? Well &lsquo;real&rsquo; negative numbers don&rsquo;t have &lsquo;real&rsquo; square roots, so we call their roots &lsquo;imaginary&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a <em>name</em>. Are they more imaginary that the &lsquo;real&rsquo; numbers? No. You don&rsquo;t need a special type of calculator or a special kind of pen to calculate with imaginary numbers. It&rsquo;s really not the best naming decision: calling a fundamental and useful concept &lsquo;imaginary&rsquo; scares and confuses people away from trying to understand it. The crux to understanding imaginary numbers is to realise how normal and unimaginary they really are.</p>

<p>Mathematics studies <em>formal abstractions</em> &ndash; mental constructions that have been defined so carefully and unambiguously that their properties become objective. 1, 2, 3 and the rest of the counting numbers, they&rsquo;re all abstractions: concepts we create to categorise, percieve and understand the world. We use abstractions to represent things, and whether abstractions are &lsquo;real&rsquo; or not doesn&rsquo;t even matter; <em>they&rsquo;re all as real or unreal as each other</em>. <strong>Imaginary numbers and real numbers exist equivalently as mathematical abstractions</strong>; useful tools to represent the world we live in.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the way the mind works. We develop concepts and abstractions to represent the world and its behaviour &ndash; mathematics studies the subset of these concepts that have been formally defined. To know <em>what infinity is</em>, or <em>what an imaginary number is</em>, is really just knowing how the mind uses abstractions to represent our surroundings.</p>

<p>The view that mathematics is just concepts and abstractions in our psychology is far from the only accepted philosophy. There&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics#Contemporary_schools_of_thought">plenty of schools of thought</a> around what maths is. For me, however, any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism">existential or borderline-spiritual</a> view of mathematical knowledge has caused more confusion and  gotten in the way of learning the actual maths.</p>

    <link href="http://georgepowell.info/writing/greshams-law-and-bitcoin-deflation/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-10T12:26:40+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://georgepowell.info/writing/greshams-law-and-bitcoin-deflation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&rsquo;re at the local store buying some bread and milk. The cashier asks you for £3.35. You open your wallet and you&rsquo;ve got two £5 notes:</p>

<h3>Crusty old £5:</h3>

<p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/03/21/article-0-00F3EED2000004B0-407_468x263.jpg" alt="Old note" /></p>

<h3>Crisp new £5:</h3>

<p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/08/24/article-0-00F3EED2000004B0-777_468x249.jpg" alt="New note" /></p>

<p>Which one do you give to the cashier?</p>

<p>Unless you&rsquo;re feeling kind &ndash; that is, you&rsquo;re not an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus">economic man</a> &ndash; you&rsquo;d want to get rid of your crusty old £5 note; they&rsquo;re worth the same amount to the cashier, so you&rsquo;d be a fool to give up the shiny new one for nothing extra. This is the basis of a paradoxical truth in economics: the measure of a currency&rsquo;s success is if it is used in transactions, yet the <em>shiny, new, better</em> £5 notes will get hoarded while the old ones get traded. <strong>People want to get rid of <em>bad</em> currency, which means it&rsquo;s used more in transactions</strong>. Enter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham's_law">Gresham&rsquo;s Law</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Gresham&rsquo;s law is an economic principle that states: &ldquo;When a government overvalues one type of money and undervalues another, the undervalued money will leave the country or disappear from circulation into hoards, while the overvalued money will flood into circulation.&rdquo; It is commonly stated as: &ldquo;Bad money drives out good&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

<p> We can rewrite the above scenario with bitcoin replacing the new shiny £5 note, and our standard fiat currencies as the old one. Presuming bitcoin is accepted universally and is as easy to pay with as paying by card, which one should you choose?</p>

<p> Bitcoin is digital gold: there is a finite supply. Cash is subject to continuous steady inflation: its value will always be gradually decreasing. So assuming the novelty of spending bitcoin has worn off in this future, it would make sense to keep your value-preserving-bitcoin and get rid of your cash. This is one reason why economists critisise the deflationary (or at least zero-inflation) nature of bitcoin.</p>

<p> The reality is complex, however, and this property doesn&rsquo;t necessarily detract from its other advantages. But this is one reason for believing that even if bitcoin is successful, it won&rsquo;t <em>replace</em> other currencies too easily.</p>

    <link href="http://georgepowell.info/writing/big-pharma-book-review/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-09T10:28:57+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://georgepowell.info/writing/big-pharma-book-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://sciencebasedpharmacy.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/bad-pharma.png" alt="Bad Pharma book cover" /></p>

<p>We take pride in our western medicine. We believe it is evidence based, objective, and working with the correct incentives. Instead, Ben Goldacre writes: <em>(p238)</em></p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip; We have occasional, small brief trials, in unrepresentative populations, testing irrelevant comparisons, measuring irrelevant outcomes, with whole trials that go missing, avoidable design flaws, and endless reporting biases that only persist because research is conducted chaotically, for commercial gain, in spuriously expensive trials. The poor-quality evidence created by this system harms patients around the world.  <strong>And if we wanted, we could fix it.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>This is a powerful book, with a clear and unforgiving message: Western medicine is not as scientific as we are told; the system is corrupt and industries work with their own profits in mind.</p>

<h3>Bad Science</h3>

<p>Goldacre is known for his blog &ndash; <a href="http://www.badscience.net/">Bad Science</a>, where he debunks claims ranging from the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/nov/16/sciencenews.g2">proficiency of homeopathy</a> to the popular <a href="http://www.badscience.net/2007/02/ms-gillian-mckeith-banned-from-calling-herself-a-doctor/">nutrician supplements of &ldquo;Dr&rdquo; Gillian Mckieth</a>. He turns his attention here to the more serious mispractices going on in western medicine as a whole.</p>

<p>It is a long book, covering over 350 pages excluding notes, illustrating his points with shocking stories and backing them up with hard evidence where possible. He covers many topics, ranging from the widely unsolved positive publication bias in academic journals, to &lsquo;regulatory capture&rsquo;: how pharmacutical companies become their own regulators. The book ends with an unforgiving tour-de-force breakdown of how marketting is used to decieve doctors and patients.</p>

<p>Goldacre knows this isn&rsquo;t an academic paper, and he communicates to his readers early on that it shouldn&rsquo;t be treated as one. However the result is a book that treads a confusing line between sensationalist popular science and a seminal analysis of a very serious problem. The points in this book, however, need to be treated with respect by the people in power, even though it is aimed at the general public.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed and learnt a lot from this book, and I&rsquo;d recommend it especially to those involved in medicine &ndash; who will be in a better position than I am to comment on the problems raised here, and maybe do something about them.</p>
