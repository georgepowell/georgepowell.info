      <p>We take pride in our western medicine. We believe it is evidence based, objective, and working with the correct incentives. Instead, Ben Goldacre writes: <em>(p238)</em></p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip; We have occasional, small brief trials, in unrepresentative populations, testing irrelevant comparisons, measuring irrelevant outcomes, with whole trials that go missing, avoidable design flaws, and endless reporting biases that only persist because research is conducted chaotically, for commercial gain, in spuriously expensive trials. The poor-quality evidence created by this system harms patients around the world.  <strong>And if we wanted, we could fix it.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>This is a powerful book, with a clear and unforgiving message: Western medicine is not as scientific as we are told; the system is corrupt and industries work with their own profits in mind.</p>

<h3>Bad Science</h3>

<p>Goldacre is known for his blog &ndash; <a href="http://www.badscience.net/">Bad Science</a>, where he debunks claims ranging from the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/nov/16/sciencenews.g2">proficiency of homeopathy</a> to the popular <a href="http://www.badscience.net/2007/02/ms-gillian-mckeith-banned-from-calling-herself-a-doctor/">nutrician supplements of &ldquo;Dr&rdquo; Gillian Mckieth</a>. He turns his attention here to the more serious mispractices going on in western medicine as a whole.</p>

<p>It is a long book, covering over 350 pages excluding notes, illustrating his points with shocking stories and backing them up with hard evidence where possible. He covers many topics, ranging from the widely unsolved positive publication bias in academic journals, to &lsquo;regulatory capture&rsquo;: how pharmacutical companies become their own regulators. The book ends with an unforgiving tour-de-force breakdown of how marketting is used to decieve doctors and patients.</p>

<p>Goldacre knows this isn&rsquo;t an academic paper, and he communicates to his readers early on that it shouldn&rsquo;t be treated as one. However the result is a book that treads a confusing line between sensationalist popular science and a seminal analysis of a very serious problem. The points in this book, however, need to be treated with respect by the people in power, even though it is aimed at the general public.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed and learnt a lot from this book, and I&rsquo;d recommend it especially to those involved in medicine &ndash; who will be in a better position than me to comment on the problems raised here, and maybe do something about them.</p>

      <h1 class="link"><a href="/writing/giving-up-on-bitcoin/">Bitcoin as a product</a></h1>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been close to investing in Bitcoin over the past couple of months; its promise as a technology comparable to the internet of 20 years ago is severely tempting. If it ever gains wide acceptence, even a small investment could be worth big money in the coming decades. But I&rsquo;ve given up &ndash; for the moment at least &ndash; on that hope. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>

<h3>Money for the people</h3>

<p>Bitcoin is oft peddled with an economic libertarian ideology. Our fiat currencies are controlled and regulated by the banks and governments, adding fees and friction to transactions. By relying on the system as it is, we hand our power to an unrepresentative minority who can profit from and manipulate our fiat currencies, not necessarily with the majority&rsquo;s best interests in mind. Bitcoin is a decentralised currency that can&rsquo;t be controlled by an individual party, it lets regular folk and small businesses make transactions to each other without needing to trust a third party. This is true, but it&rsquo;s not the whole story.</p>

<h3>The current system</h3>

<p>To gain a real understanding of where bitcoin sits as a technology, we need to understand how the current system works, and what problems (if any) bitcoin solves.</p>

<p>First, lets look at hard cash &ndash; the stuff we carry around in our wallets. Already, cash has some of the essential properties that bitcoin claims: It&rsquo;s untracable, unregulatable, and anonymous; perhaps to a greater extent even than bitcoin. Cash is used for drugs, weapons, money laundering, untaxed income, you name it. Nobody can charge a small business for the right to accept cash. Cash falls down at two hurdles, however: it&rsquo;s not digital, and control of its production is centralised. We&rsquo;ll look at what this really means in a second.</p>

<p>Now lets look at banks and the digitised money they offer through debit and credit cards. By digitising our cash and giving it to the banks, some important things have now changed: it is no longer untracable, anonymous, and unregulatable. By trusting the banks with our money we have sacrificed this for some serious benefits: They keep our money more secure than we could realistically keep cash, they offer fast digital transactions around the world and online, often with no fees or friction, and they offer interest on our savings at no extra cost. The currency is still the same as our cash, so production doesn&rsquo;t change hands. The important thing to realise here is that banks are offering a real service to us in securing and digitising our cash, and in some sense bitcoin must solve a problem not already solved by the combination of modern banking and cash.</p>

<h3>Bitcoin as a product</h3>

<p>Finally, lets look at how bitcoin fairs.</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s digital. Like the online banking and cards offered by the banks, bitcoin allows transactions to anywhere in the world with the click of a button.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s pseudoanonymous. In practise, this means that your bitcoin transactions are all tied to a pseudo-identity, which can be in theory unconnected to your real world identity. Although in practise this is hard to achieve without some knowhow in computers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNssKmeXrGs">Jerry Brito claims in an interview with Vice that you&rsquo;d need to buy bitcoin on the street with cash to guarentee full anonymity.</a></li>
<li>It&rsquo;s decentralised. This removes the need to trust a third party to manage transactions and inflation.</li>
</ul>


<h3>What bitcoin brings to the table</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s summarise:</p>

<h5>Bitcoin is</h5>

<ul>
<li>a pseudo-anonymous digital currecy.</li>
<li>a decentralised digital currency.</li>
<li>a completely fee-free digital currency (minus fees to miners)</li>
</ul>


<h5>Bitcoin is not</h5>

<ul>
<li>the only digital currency.</li>
<li>the only anonymous currency.</li>
<li>the only fee-free digital currency, for many transfers/transactions.</li>
</ul>


<p>Naturally, this leads to the question: Why would the average consumer want to switch to bitcoin? Who does bitcoin offer a real service to?</p>

<p>Anonymity is useful for people who don&rsquo;t want to be caught. Bitcoin offers a genuinely useful product for drug dealers, money launderers, and privacy enthusiasts. In these circles bitcoin is already widely used as a currency.</p>

<p>Decentralisation is desirable for those <strong>who don&rsquo;t trust the banks, and don&rsquo;t want the extra services they offer</strong>. A good example of this is when <a href="http://www.wired.com/2010/12/paypal-wikileaks/">paypal froze payments/donations to WikiLeaks</a>, bitcoin cannot in principle be controlled like this and so it became useful as a means to make donations. Bitcoin thrives here when banks/governments fail in the eyes of enough people. Until then, however, in the battle for your digital transactions, banks offer faster transactions, more security, interest on your money, and many other services that bitcoin does not.</p>

<p>Keeping your money in bitcoin means transactions take minutes rather than seconds to authorise, you have complete responsibility over your private-key &ndash; meaning there&rsquo;s no security to fraud and hacking. The government and banks don&rsquo;t respect it, and for the moment at least, most businesses don&rsquo;t accept it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get swept up in the pro-bitcoin mantra, however I struggle to see what bitcoin offers the majority of the population. It&rsquo;s important to analyse the currency as a product competing with what the banks already offer. Who really wants to sacrifice the services, security and regulation offered by the banks in exchange for a difficult to maintain anonymity and a vague feeling of control?</p>

<p>Bitcoin may be an important product to countries who&rsquo;s currencies are failing them, and to those who need anonymity. But bitcoin needs to offer a lot more to gain anything other than a minority acceptance.</p>

      <p>I decided to create a chrome extension last week, it was surprisingly simple. Chrome extensions basically give you a very simple way to inject your own javascript into whatever webpages you like, plus have access to chrome&rsquo;s own APIs for playing with tabs or storing data etc. The whole extension uses nothing but javascript (you can add jquery etc. if you like), and HTML. Even the .manifest file is JSON.</p>

<p>Subnito was my first serious chrome extension. It uses the reddit API to detect if you&rsquo;re browsing an 18+ subreddit on reddit.com and pushes you into incognito mode if so.</p>

<p>The bulk of the work is done in one short file.</p>

      <h3>&hellip; From the beautiful mix of technologies that make this site</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve put off making a website for so long (I&rsquo;ve had this domain pointing to nothing for 2+ years) because I believed that if I was going to do it, I&rsquo;d do it <em>properly</em> and build the whole thing myself. But I hate CSS and I&rsquo;ve always found more fun things to do. I&rsquo;ve finally found a few technologies cool enough for me to get excited about using, and it took me literally an hour to get this fancy looking site running.</p>

<h2>Octopress</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress">Octopress</a> is a fantastic (free, open source) blogging platform built on <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a>: a fantastic (free, open source) static site generator that uses <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>: a simple, compact, open-source language similar to python. Pages and posts are written in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> (an extremely simple syntax for writing basic documents) and auto-compiled into a static site. There&rsquo;s loads of free octopress themes available at <a href="http://opthemes.com/">opthemes.com</a>. The theme on this page is <a href="https://github.com/alexgaribay/octoflat">Octoflat</a>, a minimal flat theme built using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> &ndash; which, finally, is a large front-end web development library which makes it much easier to build functional good looking sites. Beautiful! It&rsquo;d have taken me years to build this <em>the proper way</em>.</p>

<h2>Heroku</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> is a friendly, free hosting website that supports ruby apps and deploying with a &lsquo;git push heroku master&rsquo;. Couldn&rsquo;t be simpler.</p>

<p>This website&rsquo;s sourcecode is available (complete with all posts in markdown) on <a href="https://github.com/georgepowell">my GitHub page</a>, but if you want to make a copycat of some sort you&rsquo;d be best working from the octopress default template directly.</p>
