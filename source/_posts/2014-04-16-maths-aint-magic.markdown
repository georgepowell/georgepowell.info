Imaginary numbers and the nature of mathematics
===============================================

I first heard of imaginary numbers when someone showed me the [Mandelbrot Set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set):

They described it to me:

 > The x axis is for the real numbers, and the y axis is for the imaginary numbers. The colour of each pixel is determined by the properties of the imaginary and real numbers it represents.

My reaction was confusion, as it should have been. That picture sure doesn't look imaginary. And how can these numbers exist on a computer if they're imaginary? Maybe I'm not smart enough to understand, maybe it's a concept only accessible to the minds of mathematitions. What are imaginary numbers?

 > Well... They're *made up* numbers that don't really exist like normal numbers do. There's **no** number that can be squared into a negative number, so we make up the imaginary numbers!

I learnt to program in my teens and when I [wrote my own mandelbrot set visualiser](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/501340) I realised it doesn't really need *imaginary-made-up* numbers after all. All it needs is two standard real numbers and a formula.

What's 'imaginary' about imaginary numbers then? Well 'real' negative numbers don't have 'real' square roots, so we call their roots 'imaginary'. It's a *name*. Are they more imaginary that the 'real' numbers? No. You don't need a special type of calculator or a special kind of pen to calculate with imaginary numbers. It's really not the best naming decision: calling a fundamental and useful concept 'imaginary' scares and confuses people away from trying to understand it. The crux to understanding imaginary numbers is to realise how normal and unimaginary they really are.

Mathematics studies *formal abstractions* - mental constructions that have been defined so carefully and unambiguously that their properties become objective. 1, 2, 3 and the rest of the counting numbers, they're all abstractions: concepts we create to categorise, percieve and understand the world. We use abstractions to represent things, and whether abstractions are 'real' or not doesn't even matter; *they're all as real or unreal as each other*. Imaginary numbers exist alongside all the real numbers as mathematical abstractions, and useful tools to represent the world we live in.

It's the way the mind works. We develop concepts and abstractions to represent the world and its behaviour - mathematics studies the subset of these concepts that have been formally defined. To know *what infinity is*, or *what an imaginary number is*, is really just knowing how the mind uses abstractions to represent our surroundings. 

The view that mathematics is just concepts and abstractions in our psychology is far from the only accepted philosophy. There's [plenty of schools of thought](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics#Contemporary_schools_of_thought) around what maths is. For me, however, any [existential or borderline-spiritual](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism) view of mathematical knowledge has caused more confusion and  gotten in the way of learning the actual maths.
