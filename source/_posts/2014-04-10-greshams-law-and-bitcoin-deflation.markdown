You're at the local store buying some bread and milk. The cashier asks you for £3.35. You open your wallet and you've got two £5 notes:

### Crusty old £5:

### Crisp new £5:

Which one do you give to the cashier?

Unless you're feeling kind - that is, you're not an [economic man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus) - you'd want to get rid of your crusty old £5 note; they're worth the same amount to the cashier, so you'd be a fool to give up the shiny new one for nothing extra. This is the basis of a paradoxical truth in economics: the measure of a currency's success is if it is used in transactions, yet the *shiny, new, better* £5 notes will get hoarded while the old ones get traded. **People want to get rid of *bad* currency, which means it's used more in transactions**. Enter [Gresham's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham's_law):

 > Gresham's law is an economic principle that states: "When a government overvalues one type of money and undervalues another, the undervalued money will leave the country or disappear from circulation into hoards, while the overvalued money will flood into circulation." It is commonly stated as: "Bad money drives out good".

 We can rewrite the above scenario with bitcoin replacing the new shiny £5 note, and our standard fiat currencies as the old one. Presuming bitcoin is accepted universally and is as easy to pay with as paying by card, which one should you choose?

 Bitcoin is digital gold: there is a finite supply. Cash is subject to continuous steady inflation: its value will always be gradually decreasing. So assuming the novelty of spending bitcoin has worn off in this future, it would make sense to keep your value-preserving-bitcoin and get rid of your cash. This is one reason why economists critisise the deflationary (or at least zero-inflation) nature of bitcoin.

 The reality is complex, however, and this property doesn't necessarily detract from its other advantages. But this is one reason for believing that even if bitcoin is successful, it won't *replace* other currencies too easily.
