### ... From the beautiful mix of technologies that make this site

I've put off making a website for so long (I've had this domain pointing to nothing for 2+ years) because I believed that if I was going to do it, I'd do it *properly* and build the whole thing myself. But I dislike CSS and I've always found more fun things to do. I've finally found a few technologies cool enough for me to get excited about using, and it only took an hour to get this fancy looking site running.

## Octopress

[Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) is a fantastic (free, open source) blogging platform built on [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll): a fantastic (free, open source) static site generator that uses [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/): a simple, compact, open-source language similar to python. Pages and posts are written in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (an extremely simple syntax for writing basic documents) and auto-compiled into a static site. There's loads of free octopress themes available at [opthemes.com](http://opthemes.com/). The theme on this page is [Octoflat](https://github.com/alexgaribay/octoflat), a minimal flat theme built using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - which, finally, is a large front-end web development library which makes it much easier to build functional good looking sites. Beautiful! It'd have taken me years to build this *the proper way*.

## Heroku

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a hosting website that supports ruby apps and deploying with a 'git push heroku master'. Couldn't be simpler.

This website's sourcecode is available (complete with all posts in markdown) on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/georgepowell), but if you want to make a copycat of some sort you'd be best working from the octopress default template directly.
