Who am I?
=========

![Me](/images/me.png)

I'm a software developer currently studying computer science at the University of Sheffield. I enjoy making things, designing things, writing, and solving problems. I also love the outdoors and try to keep a collection of hobbies like slacklining, rock climbing, cycling and [juggling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zJC3dYOOv4).

I'm happy to be contacted for software development positions. Feel free to [drop me an email at georgepowell_1@hotmail.co.uk](mailto:georgepowell_1@hotmail.co.uk).

## Skills

 - **Extremely fast software prototyping**

   Building usable demos or proof of concepts within hours.

 - **Writing clean and concise code**
   
   Working towards the ideal of being self-documenting with no need for comments.

 - **Communicating, writing, and public speaking**

   Communicating and discussing ideas is as important as the ideas themselves. I enjoy technical writing and explaining things, and am confident with public speaking.

Wrote a [comprehensive report](/docs/improving-simulation-methods.pdf) for the team to base further improvements on. Worked with C++ and XSLT. Wrote about it [here](/writing/i-for-one-welcome-our-new-insect-overlords/) and [here](/writing/numerical-methods-and-the-green-brain-project/).
