Who am I?
=========

![Me](/images/me.png)

I'm a software developer currently studying computer science at the University of Sheffield. I enjoy making things, designing things, writing, and solving problems. I also love the outdoors and try to keep a large collection of hobbies like slacklining, rock climbing, cycling and [juggling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zJC3dYOOv4).

## Work
<!--
 - #### **Neural network research internship at the [Green Brain Project](http://greenbrain.group.shef.ac.uk/)**

   6 week paid research internship implementing automated analytic solution methods for complex neural networks. Implemented algorithms that inspected the network topology and automatically solved them in the most efficient way, often resulting in orders of magnitude in efficiency gains from the default iterative solution methods.
-->
 - #### **Android developer at [Existor](http://www.existor.com/)**
   
   Responsible for developing Android applications, including [Cleverbot Android (50,000+ installs)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icogno.cleverbot), [CleverTweet (3,000+ installs)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.existor.Clevertweeter) and the [Clevermessage SMS auto responder (2,000+ installs)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.existor.clevermessageapp). I took part in technical discussions regarding the core artificial intelligence techniques, and completed independent research into possible new approaches to incorporating hierachical pattern recognition methods into cleverbot's natural language understanding ([demo of early work on github](https://github.com/georgepowell/markov_chain_visualisation)).
 
 - #### **ASP.NET MVC back-end developer for [foundbite.co](http://foundbite.co) at [Mendzapp](http://mendzapp.com/)**
   
   Mendzapp is a software development company started by [James Mundy](http://about.me/JamesMundy). We built foundbite together over the course of a year, with a succesfull funding grant from [AppCampus](http://www.appcampus.fi). I left to continue university and James continues to work building foundbite. Foundbite has recieved an extremely positive reaction with [hundreds of reviews averaging 4.5+ stars](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/foundbite/243343f7-36e4-454d-8bbd-b15d447037ab) with Android and iOS versions on the way.
 
 - #### **C# Silverlight developer at [Datong](http://www.datong.co.uk/)**
   
   Worked with an experienced team of senior developers adding features to a mature covert tracking application. Gained invaluable experience developing large scale C# applications.
