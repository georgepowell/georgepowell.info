Who am I?
=========

I'm a software developer currently studying computer science at the University of Sheffield. I enjoy making things, designing things, writing, and solving problems. I also love the outdoors and try to keep a large collection of hobbies like slacklining, rock climbing, cycling and [juggling](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zJC3dYOOv4).

## Work

 - #### **Android developer at [Existor](http://www.existor.com/)**

I took part in technical discussions regarding the core artificial intelligence techniques, and completed independent research into possible new approaches to incorporating hierachical pattern recognition methods into cleverbot's natural language understanding ([demo of early work on github](https://github.com/georgepowell/markov_chain_visualisation)).
